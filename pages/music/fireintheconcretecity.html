					<p>A house is afire in this concrete city<br />
					The wood is a-burnin'; the smoke billows high<br />
					You can hear all  the screams from the bodies a-burnin'<br />
					Soaring up to the skies and into the night</p>
					<p>All over this house the gasoline's hissing<br />
					A sole wooden match is blackened and charred<br />
					The paint's peeling now; sparks drop from the rafters<br />
					The fire is spreading, so fast and so far</p>
					<p>A man standing tall, with his wife and his children<br />
					Waiting to die on  their pyre alight<br />
					There's no passage out, no hope for a-livin'<br />
					No prayers but the smoke's will reach heaven now</p>
					<p>On the door of the house a paper's a-curlin'<br />
					Small white and stabbed to the door on a nail<br />
					'This home is foreclosed,' the paper's a-screaming<br />
					But the home is afire and the family is gone</p>

					<p>Darling, I've been thinking<br />
					About the way we've been<br />
					And I'm not thinking clearly<br />
					But I think it's time to leave</p>

					<p>When I see your lips, baby<br />
					And your sweet smile for me<br />
					It's not those lips I'm wantin'<br />
					It's another's lips I see</p>

					<p>And when I see your eyes, darlin'<br />
					Though I never would've guessed<br />
					And know it's not your fault baby<br />
					But it ain't your eyes I love best</p>

					<p>I don't know when this happened <br />
					It just came over me<br />
					'Cause when I thought of ending<br />
					This ain't how I thought it'd be</p>

					<p>And I'm sorry for the heartache<br />
					I never meant to cause you pain<br />
					But lately, I've been thinking<br />
					It's time I catch a train</p>

					<p>Darling, I've been thinking<br />
					About the way we've been<br />
					And now I'm thinking clearly<br />
					And I know it's time to leave</p>

					<p>The dust it gathers round, a-churning in the air<br />
					The sun is blotted out, the storm's a-coming near<br />
					The crops are lying down, dead beneath the dust<br />
					The farmers have all gone; their plows begin to rust</p>
					<p>Black rollers and the dirt scattered out across the plains<br />
					The wind's a-blowin' wild; the plow, it broke the plains<br />
					The plow, it broke the plains</p>
					<p>And soon I will be gone driving out into the West<br />
					As blizzards billow round, I drive away through all the dust<br />
					There's nothing in the West I hear a-traveling on<br />
					No work nor food nor rest; that California's gone</p>
					<p>Black rollers and the dirt scattered out across the plains<br />
					The wind's a-blowin' wild; the plow, it broke the plains<br />
					The plow, it broke the plains</p>

					<p>The wind is cold outside, babe<br />
					And you don't have to leave<br />
					And we can talk this out, babe<br />
					We can have ourselves some peace</p>
					<p>Remember long ago babe<br />
					the sand upon the beach<br />
					the grains ran through our fingers<br />
					and my tongue it touched your teeth</p>
					<p>Or the days of summer splendor<br />
					when the clear blue skies above<br />
					were filled with birds a-singing<br />
					all their whistling songs of love</p>
					<p>And you don't have to do this, darlin'<br />
					And you don't have to leave<br />
					Do what you're going to do, honey<br />
					But please don't make me plead<br />
					I'll take what you can give me<br />
					And even if I cry<br />
					Don't worry about me, babe<br />
					I'm doin' fine</p>
					<p>You used to kiss my mouth, love<br />
					In winters cold and bleak<br />
					But when you've kissed me lately<br />
					You just peck me on the cheek</p>
					<p>And know that I would give you<br />
					All the love my heart could bear<br />
					But if love ain't worth much to you<br />
					You can give me back my share</p>
					<p>And so goodbye my lover<br />
					And fare thee well, my friend<br />
					I wish we could be cured, love<br />
					But if not we'll have to end</p>
					<p>And I'm sorry that I hurt you<br />
					and that's all I have to say<br />
					I'd rather not be keeping you<br />
					from other things today<br />
					But in those empty moments<br />
					If my face disturbs your mind<br />
					Don't worry about me, babe<br />
					I'm doin' fine</p>
