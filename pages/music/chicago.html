						<p>Time has come and gone<br />
						And I'll be moving on so this<br />
						Is where I say farewell</p>
						<p>The winding road a-calls</br />
						And though the rain it falls, I will</br />
						I will find my way</p>
						<p>Lover, don't fret for me<br />
						And please, don't wait for me I know<br />
						that you will be just fine</p>
						<p>You'll find solid ground<br />
						A love not cast around by storms<br />
						and shifting winds<p/>
						<p>Skies are dark this morn<br />
						And I will soon be borne on winds<br />
						to places far away<p/>
						<p>The road it beckons me<br />
						And love, my final plea is please<br />
						Please don't think of me<p/>
						<p>Please don't think of me<p/>

						<p>It's eight o'clock in the morning, and the train's a-pulling in<br/ >
						You're leaving for Chicago, a place I've never been<br/ >
						And though the summer's warm I feel a quiet chill<br/ >
						"I love you and things'll go just how they will."</p>
						<p>It's loud here in Chicago, you can hear the rolling cars <br/ >
						The sound of shouts and fighting as men step out from the bars<br/ >
						And though I'm missing you I feel a quiet thrill<br/ >
						"I love you but things'll go just how they will."</p>
						<p>It's quiet here without you as the season bleeds away<br/ >
						Soon the summer's gone and now the autumn's come to stay<br/ >
						Leaves red upon the trees and on the ground they spill<br/ >
						"I love you and things'll go just how they will."</p>
						<p>The city's loud and charming and the snow is falling white<br/ >
						Despite the winter breeze the rushing coldness has no bite <br/ >
						I'm missing you today but I'm enchanted still<br/ >
						"I love you but thing'll go just how they will." </p>
						<p>I'd rid my life of riches just to join you where you are<br/ >
						To see your shining eyes and the winsome smile that once you wore<br/ >
						I'm doing fine for now, but my heart'll ache until<br/ >
						I see you but things'll go just how they will</p>
						<p>I think it's best we part now, I heard from her today<br/ >
						That Chicago's a-treating her kindly and it's there that she'll stay<br/ >
						That we'll both be better off alone with just some time to heal<br/ >
						I love you but things, they go just how they will</p>

						<p>A lonely farm amidst the fields, a cow's a-grazing near<br />
						the creek it murmurs quietly, and the skies are high and clear</p>
						<p>A painted church is standing tall, in the center of the town<br />
						Its congregants are quiet now and their heads are bowin' down</p>
						<p>a hundred years have passed, my son, that town's a city now<br />
						the smoke stacks churnin' coal and tar; the piston's killed the plow</p>
						<p>And that creek is blackened now, my son, and the smog's a hanging grey<br />
						It's the poor who're now a-livin' here, all the rich have moved away</p>
						<p>and a hundred years have passed once more with the rich inside their tomb<br />
						Ten fathoms down beneath the ground, a-waiting for the boom</p>
						<p>Cause that big old town's a graveyard now and the sky's a-bleeding red<br />
						and the mushroom cloud it soars above all the people there are dead</p>

						<p>In the town of Laredo lives a girl named Rose Holden<br />
						She never will love me, she'd have me believe<br />
						A tall handsome girl, with a heart warm and golden,<br />
						I'd not meant to stay, but now I'll never leave</p>
						<p>Her father a preacher, and I but a cowboy<br />
						I loved her to death, and my love she'd denied<br />
						On my back in the dirt, and my blood flown' from me<br />
						Her feet fall so slow, and Rosie comes to my side.</p>
						<p>We'll never be married, she told me so sadly<br />
						That quiet pale night, in the light of the moon<br />
						As she turned away, I felt my heart taken from me<br />
						And stumbled along, to the darkened saloon</p>
						<p>A man walked inside as to the drink I was taking,<br />
						With a coat long and dark, and a snarl in his eye<br />
						His hand on his pistol, his fingers a-twitchin',<br />
						I could not know that, by that pistol I'd die</p>
						<p>A way-farin' stranger, from out in West Texas<br />
						He told me there wasn't a town where he belonged<br />
						He'd stopped for the night and he'd be gone by breakfast<br />
						Whatever his business, he wouldn't be long</p>
						<p>I stumbled back homeward, and I heard the Sheriff<br />
						Speaking in tones so low and reserved<br />
						That there was an outlaw, who'd come from West Texas<br />
						And that someone would give him the end he deserved</p>
						<p>I fell in my bed, my mind sleeplessly wanderin',<br />
						I realized the stranger was the outlaw he knew<br />
						As the sun rose that mornin', my pistol was waitin',<br />
						A gunfight I'd win and, I'd win Rosie too</p>
						<p>Went to the saloon and the stranger was runnin'<br />
						Right out the door, his black coat all a blur<br />
						I readied my pistol, and followed him closely,<br />
						I shouted behind him, I'd kill him for sure</p>
						<p>I lie here a-bleedin', and Rosie is with me,<br />
						And kisses me softly as she starts to cry<br />
						I'll never forget you, she whispers so sweetly<br />
						My hand in her hand, it's my time to die.</p>

						But it don't want for me</p>
						<p>And there ain't no sense in fightin', baby<br />
