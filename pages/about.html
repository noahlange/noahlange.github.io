	<p class="lead">A few words...</p>
	<p>I'm a prospective 2014 graduate of Luther College, and have focused my studies for the last four years in Creative Writing and Computer Science.</p>
	<p>I've been working with web technologies for the last decade, most heavily in HTML and CSS. I've since expanded my palette to include Javascript, JQuery and some of the more popular web application frameworks.</p>
	<p>From my Computer Science degree, I've gained a solid foundation in programming, and have experience in Python, Java and C#.</p>
	<p>The Adobe Creative Suite has been a core part of my workflow ever since I learned to use Adobe Photoshop Elements back in high school. Nearing the end of college, I've learned to use Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator to supplement my Photoshop expertise.</p>
	<p>Concision and clarity are at the core of my strengths as a writer, and a designer. I've found that paring things down to their essence and cutting away the cruft is the best way of breaking through to any audience, whether or not they're readers or end-users.</p>
	<p>I'm passionate about communication. Design, code and prose are my weapons of choice.</p>
	<p>Best,</p>
