	<p>I'm a prospective 2014 graduate of Luther College, having focused my studies in English and Computer Science.</p>
	<p>I've been working with web technologies for the last ten years, focusing most heavily in HTML and CSS. In the last few I've worked on expanding my palette to include Javascript, JQuery and some of the more popular web application frameworks.</p>
	<p>I have a solid background in Computer Science, and have experience in Python, Java, C# and MySQL.</p>
	<p>The Adobe Creative Suite has been a core part of my workflow ever since I learned to use Adobe Photoshop Elements back in high school. Nearing the end of college, I've learned to use Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator to supplement my Photoshop expertise.</p>
	<p>I'm passionate about good visual design and rock-solid, efficient code.</p>
